        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-xl">
          I'm an IT student with a strong interest in frontend development and user experience design. I'm currently learning React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, and I love building clean, responsive interfaces.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-xl">
          My goal is to grow as a developer through real-world projects, internships, and collaboration. Outside of tech, I enjoy photography, reading about new gadgets, and exploring the creative side of design.
